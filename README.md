# Welcome everyone to SE4Robotics' course
During the course you will write blog posts, so let's get one.
We will use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting and managing the blog, it basically combines the [Github workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and [Jekyll ruby's blog engine](https://jekyllrb.com/).
Before continuing, please watch this video (it's just 4 min): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MsN8gpT6jY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MsN8gpT6jY).
What you are going to do is to fork this repository (which is a fork of a template) and customize to use it.

## How to fork and adapt it

1. Fork this repository.
2. Change the name of your repository (the cooler, the better)
2. Edit `_config.yml` file in the following lines:
  ```
  url: 'http://sopapiglobo.github.io' # replace 'sopapiglobo' with your github username
  baseurl: '/baseurlname/' # it will look: http://your-gh-username.github.io/baseurlname
  ```
  We encourage you to modify the values of `title`, `subtitle`, `email`, `email2` and `description` too :-).

3. Create your new post by clone any markdown archive in `_posts` folder. Here's a [quick Markdown tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/). 
  Keep in mind that *it may take some minutes* to see the post published.
4. Read about Github Pages in their official documentation.

## Customize it
You can customize in all the ways you want, [read more here](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium) and [here](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/).
